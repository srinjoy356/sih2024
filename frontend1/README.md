# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

# Drug Inventory and Supply Chain Management System

This project is a decentralized Drug Supply Chain Management System built using React for the frontend, Python (Flask) for the backend, and Solidity on the Ethereum blockchain. The system ensures transparency, traceability, and security in the supply chain of pharmaceutical drugs.

# Problem Statement

- **Counterfeit Medicines:** Counterfeit drugs pose a major risk to public health and safety.Without a reliable way to verify the authenticity of medicines, consumers and healthcare providers at risk of receiving substandard or fraudulent products.
- **Inefficient Inventory Management:** Traditional inventory management systems often lack real-time tracking and reporting capabilities, leading to issues such as stockouts, overstocking, and inefficient resource utilization.

- **Lack of Supply Chain Transparency:** The complexity of the pharmaceutical supply chain, which includes manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and retailers, can lead to gaps in accountability and traceability.
This makes it difficult to pinpoint the source of issues or detect malpractices.


# Solution
- **Drug Inventory Management System:** We are developing a comprehensive drug inventory management system using Flask, Python, and React. This system will feature:


- **Blockchain-Based Supply Chain Management:** To enhance supply chain transparency and combat counterfeit medicines, we are integrating blockchain technology into our system. This involves:
Blockchain Integration: Using Solidity and Ethereum to create a blockchain-based supply chain network. This network will link all participants in the supply chain, including manufacturers, wholesalers, distributors, and retailers.

Traceability: Implementing smart contracts to record every transaction and movement of drugs across the supply chain. This will allow us to trace the origin of each product and verify its authenticity.

Malpractice Detection: By analyzing the blockchain data, we can identify any breaks in the supply chain or potential instances of malpractice, such as counterfeit products or unauthorized distribution.


# Tech Stack

- **Flask and Python:**
 Flask: A lightweight web framework for building the backend of the drug inventory management system. It provides a simple and flexible way to handle API requests, manage data, and implement business logic.

Python: The programming language used for backend development, data processing, and integration with various services.

- **React:** React.js: A JavaScript library for building dynamic and responsive user interfaces.It will be used to develop the frontend of the inventory management system, providing users with interactive dashboards and real-time data visualization.
- **Solidity and Ethereum:** 
Solidity: A programming language for writing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. We will use Solidity to create smart contracts that handle the recording and verification of transactions within the supply chain.

Ethereum: A decentralized blockchain platform that supports smart contracts and provides a secure and transparent environment for managing supply chain data.


# Conclusion
Our drug inventory and supply chain management system aims to address the critical issues facing the pharmaceutical industry by leveraging modern technologies. By combining Flask, Python, React, Solidity, and Ethereum, we are creating a robust solution that enhances inventory management, ensures drug authenticity, and provides complete transparency throughout the supply chain.
